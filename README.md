# C++-Maze-Game-with-Gems
# This project focuses on streamlining 2D character manipulation within a maze game. Players control their character using arrow keys, translating raw input into directional movement. Enemies navigate the maze based on a random algorithm, moving in any direction # # when a random integer (1-100) is divided by 4.

# Gems, represented by "^", are placed randomly in the maze's open spaces, and the scroll, denoted by "%", appears once all gems are collected. The maze layout, defined by a rectangular text file of asterisks (walls) and spaces (paths), is flexible, accommodating #  any shape within these parameters.

# Scoring is straightforward: each gem collected awards 10 points, while obtaining the scroll yields 100 points. The scoreboard, updated upon game completion or failure, displays the total score, encouraging players to improve their performance.

# The main menu provides a clear overview of the game's objectives, hazards, and victory conditions, ensuring players understand the gameplay mechanics and goals from the outset. This approach enhances user experience by offering intuitive navigation and engaging, strategic gameplay.

# This game is designed for easy operation: it runs through a .bat file, with all required files housed in a single folder.
